-  Hi, I’m @coder-surendra
-  I’m interested in python & javascript. (**_Ikr, super cliche combo_**)
-  I’m currently reading the book : Automate the boring stuff with python
-  Also I do try to solve atleast one problem from leetcode daily, which are uploaded on my [leetcode repo](https://github.com/coder-surendra/leetcode).
